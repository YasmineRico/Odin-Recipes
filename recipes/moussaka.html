        <h1>Traditional Moussaka Recipe</h1>
        

        <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>Moussaka is a traditional Greek dish that is like 
                an eggplant casserole. The recipe calls for eggplant, potatoes, 
                beef or lamb, finishing with bechamel sauce. It is the ultimate
                comfort food. 
            </p>Moussaka is a core memory for me. While living in Belgium I would
                frequent Fin de Siecle, highly recommend eating there. I took my 
				first bite and was hooked. Now I make it at home for special occasions,
                even my 2 year old God-Daughter enjoys it!

        <h2>Steps to Cook</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Prepare the eggplants by removing the stalks and 
					cut into thick slices. Season with Salt and set in 
					colander for 30 minutes. 
				</li>
				<li>AFter 30 minutes rinse the eggplants and squeeze with
					your hands to get rid of excess water. Place in baking 
					dish when dry.
				</li>
				<li>While the eggplants are baking, slice potatoes by 1/4 of
					an inch. Place the eggplants in the bottom of the baking, 
					add potatoes. bake for 20 minutes. 
				</li>
				<li>Heat a large pan to medium-high add olive oil. Stir in Chopped
					onions saute until golden. Stir in the ground meat once it has 
					browned add garlic and tomato paste. Pour the glass of Red Wine.
					Add tomatoes, sugar, bay leaf and salt/pepper to taste. 
				</li>
				<li>Bring to a boil then turn the heat down and simmer with lid on for
					30 minutes or until most juices have evaporated. 
				</li>
				<li>For the Bechamel sauce we will use a large pan and melt butter over
					low-medium heat. Whisk in the flour to make a paste. Steadily add in 
					warmed milk while whisking the mixture. This will ensure there are no 
					lumps in the sauce. Once complete the sauce should have the consistency
					of thick cream. 
				</li>
				<li>Once the Bechamel sauce is finished remove from the heat. We will now 
					add in the egg yolks, salt, pepper, pinch of nutmeg and grated cheese. 
					Make sure to leave enough cheese to sprinkle on top of the Moussaka for 
					later. Whisk the mixture together add salt to taste. 
				</li>
				<li>Now it's time for assembly! In a large baking dish, butter the bottom and
					sides and layer the potatoes first. Next we will add half of the eggplants 
					and pur in all of the meat sauce, spreading it evenly. Add the second layer 
					of eggplants and top it off with the bechamel sauce smoothing over with a 
					spatula. Sprinkle the remaining cheese and top.
				</li>
				<li>Preheat oven to 350F/180C. Bake the moussaka for 60 minutes or until golden 
					brown. Leave it out to cool down. 
				</li>
				<li> Now you're ready to feast on delicious homemade moussaka! As an added tip
					its best to enjoy with a glass of wine. Enjoy!
